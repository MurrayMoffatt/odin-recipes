  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>I made this slow cooker beef stew with onion soup mix, red wine, and veggies on a snowy winter day. It made the house smell good all day long and our tummies were full after eating it! It was the best stew I've ever had.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 pounds cubed beef stew meat</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 onions, sliced</li>
    <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
    <li>4 large potatoes, cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup baby carrots</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
    <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place meat in a large plastic bag. Combine 1/4 cup flour with salt in a small bowl; pour into the bag and shake to coat meat.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add floured meat and cook in batches if necessary, until evenly browned on the outside. Transfer meat to a slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in the same skillet. Add onions and sauté until softened. Transfer to the slow cooker. Pour red wine into the skillet and stir to loosen any browned bits of food on the bottom. Remove from the heat and pour into the slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Add potatoes, carrots, parsley, and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir 2 cups boiling water and dry soup mix together in a small bowl; pour into the slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on High for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to Low and cook for 6 hours, or until meat is fork tender. Mix 1/4 cup warm water and 2 tablespoons flour together in a small bowl; stir into stew and cook, uncovered, until thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
